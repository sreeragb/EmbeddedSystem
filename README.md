# EmbeddedSystem
Small projects implemented in arduino and other micro controllers. Ideas picked from other internet sources. 
Electronic Dice: Implement a push-button controlled dice that displays results on LEDs. Feel free to use LEDs, LCD, or even an 8x8 LED Matrix display, whichever suits your interest.
Here the display used is single 7 segment display. It is an anode display. Hence to turn ON the segment we have to send "Low" and turn ON we have to send "HIGH".
